This is my workspace.
Here you will find all my softwares and codes in various programming language.
All software are released under a GNU/GPLv3 licence, even where not specified.
My main softwares are in dedicated repositories. So, go there.

Here you can find almost a program for each language which I (at least minimally) know.
Please, if you wish to install these softwares, try to download it at <http://www.giovannicapuano.net/sezioni.php?titolo=i-miei-programmi>.
In this way, you will help me to mean the number of people affected by the various packages, in way to continue their developing.
I'm sorry for non-italian people, but the most of they are in italian language. But their UI should be very simple to means each feature :)
