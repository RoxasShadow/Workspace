This is my workspace.
Here you will found all my works in various programming language.
All software are released under a GNU/GPLv3 licence, even where not specified.

Here you can to found almost a program for each language which I (at least minimally) know, except PHP (you can give a look at OcarinaProject repository).
Please, if you wish to install these softwares, try to download it at <http://www.giovannicapuano.net/sezioni.php?titolo=i-miei-programmi>.
In this way, you will help me to mean the number of people affected by the various packages, in way to continue their developing.
I'm sorry for non-italian people, but the most of they are in italian language. But their UI should be very simple to means each feature :)

*Best projects:
	Bash/WIL
	Java/GjTris
	Java/GjBoard
	Java/ClipManager
	Java/Mantis
	Python/rs-sendpkm(-bw)
	Python/dmg
In Perl you can found some (in)utilities for your PC, and in VB.NET some softwares which not even remember.

Happy hacking!
